Notes on how macros and such

- The caches are dynamically allocated arrays

- Macros to know:
	DCA - Data cache associativity
	DCS - Data cache set count
	ICA - Instruction cache associativity
	ICS - Instruction cache set count
	
	i_index(x) and d_index(x) will give you the index bits of x
	i_tag(x) and d_tag(x) will give you the tag bits of x
